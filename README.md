# news-app

Introduction
------------

- The application is written fully in Kotlin and uses [Clean Architecture based on MVVM and Repository patterns](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide). It also implements [MVI architecture](https://www.raywenderlich.com/817602-mvi-architecture-for-android-tutorial-getting-started) in itâ€™s Presentation layer, one of the newest architecture patterns for Android, inspired by the unidirectional and cyclical nature of the Cycle.js framework.

- Android Jetpack components are used to sustain the architectures, some components that are used: ViewModel, MutableLiveData, Lifecycles, Navigation component, BottomNavCom...

- The application gets the data from [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/), using OKHttp, Retrofit and Moshi to parse it. OkHttp cache implemented. 

- Pagination was also made utilising a custom implementation of the [Epoxy component](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy).

- Kotlin Coroutines are used for background tasks and multitasking.

- Koin is used for dependency injection.

- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) is used for animations.

- The project hosts 9 modules each serving a distinguished purpose (Figured from the name).

- The main app hosts one activity and 5 fragments connected with the Jetpack navigation component.
